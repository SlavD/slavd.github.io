My name is Slawomir Dorzak. I currently live in Dublin, Ireland where I work as a Software Engineer. Over the years I have worked for number of companies, tried to develop my own product, worked with number of programming languages and frameworks. I'll use this blog to write about things I find interesting.

## Some things I'm currently interested in

* Distributed application design
* Cloud computing
* Software architecture
* Enterpreneurship
* Go language
* Mobile development
